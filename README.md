React Native components which implement [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).

This repository has been heavily developed on top of the [mrn](https://github.com/binggg/mrn) project started by **@binggg**. Improvements include support for the latest React Native versions,
many bug fixes, extra components, backward compatibility to Android SDK API 16 and more.

> Please keep in mind this is still a work in progress. The master branch is subject to breaking changes.
